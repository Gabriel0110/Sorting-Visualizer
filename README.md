# Sorting-Visualizer
GUI visualizer to see how sorting algorithms work and compare their speed.

If you wish to try it out, you can clone/download the repository, and run the "sorting_visualizer.exe" file in the ./dist/sorting_visualizer folder.

The sorting algorithms used are not of my creation nor design -- you can find the algorithms here: https://stackabuse.com/sorting-algorithms-in-python/
