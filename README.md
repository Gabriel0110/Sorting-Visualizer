# Sorting-Visualizer
GUI visualizer to see how sorting algorithms work and compare their speed.

You can simply have the bars sorted and see their duration of sort time, or you can turn on the animations and watch the sort happen to see how exactly the algorithm works.

If you wish to try it out, you can clone/download the repository, and run the "sorting_visualizer.exe" file in the ./dist/sorting_visualizer folder.

The sorting algorithms used are not of my creation nor design -- you can find the algorithms here: https://stackabuse.com/sorting-algorithms-in-python/
